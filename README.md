# Algorithmic Toolbox
This repository contains my solutions to the programming assignments within the [Algorithmic Toolbox](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithmic-toolbox) course. This course is the first of six in the Data Structures and Algorithms Specialization offered by UC San Diego, which I enrolled in through Google CSSI Coursera. All solutions are written in Python3.

The PDF in each folder details the programming challenges presented in each week of the course.
